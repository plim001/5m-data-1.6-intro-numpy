## Instructions

Paste the answer as Python in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Given the following numpy array:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

Write a Python code to multiply each element in the array by 2.

Answer:

```python
multiply_arr_by_2 = arr * 2
```

### Question 2

Given the following 2D numpy array:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Write a Python code to select the second row of the array.

Answer:

```python
second_row = arr[1]
```

### Question 3

Create a 2D numpy array of shape (5, 5) filled with the number 1.

Answer:

```python
arr2d = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])
arr2d.shape
```

### Question 4

Given the following 2D numpy array:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Write a Python code to calculate the sum of all the elements in each row.

Answer:

```python
sum_row = arr.sum(axis=0)
sum_row
```

### Question 5

Given the following 2D numpy array:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Write a Python code to calculate the average of all the elements.

Answer:

```python
avg_num = arr.mean()
avg_num
```
